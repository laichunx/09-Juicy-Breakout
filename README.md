# 09-Juicy-Breakout
In this project, I am trying to make the game juicy.
First, I applied background music to level 1, level 2 and the game over page.
Second, I create spark particle to emit when the ball hitting a tile.
However, the particle emit function seems not working while placing together with queue_free. Therefore, I put the particle emit function into the split ball.
Third, I added tweeting and easing to the tiles and the paddle.
Thats all I added to my game. Although it's not juicy as the one shown in the youtube video. I feel satisfied for learned these new skills in Godot.
